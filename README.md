# Mini-Projects | Tailwind CSS From Scratch

This is a series of 6 mini-projects I built as part of a course by Brad Traversy that I took:

[Tailwind CSS From Scratch | Learn By Building Projects](https://www.udemy.com/course/tailwind-from-scratch/)

There are 6 bigger projects from the same course whose repositories can be found [here](https://github.com/DakouriKobri/tailwind-from-scratch-course-bigger-projects).

## Installation

After cloning the repository, cd into an individual project directory of interest, then use [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install) as follows to install all the dependencies with:

```bash
  npm install
```

Next, to watch any style change of effect, run

```bash
  npm run watch

Finally, run live-server on the index.html file to see the result in the browser.
